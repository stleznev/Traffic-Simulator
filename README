Traffic Simulator

To work with this project some packages are necessary: scikitlearn, networkx, numpy, matplotlib.

First of all is the initialize_graph.py file, it contains functions to generate random graph and to draw it using networkx and matplotlib.

Then there is initialize_agents.py which contains the «Agent» class and the function to create some arbitrary amount of agents in a list.

The main feature is the simulation.py, it contains the main classes such as «Simulation_baseline», which essentially make the traffic simulation happen.

The file baseline_dijkstra.py is there temporarily to store some helpful functions used by simulation classes.

The file testing.py contains some tests to ensure the correctness of (any) simulation execution.
